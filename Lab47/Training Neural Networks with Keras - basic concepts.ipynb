    "# Training Neural Networks with Keras - Basic Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Basic Structure of a Neural Network\n",
    "In Keras, a neural network model is defined using layers that transform input data into desired outputs. \n",
    "Layers are the basic building blocks of neural networks in Keras. A layer consists of a tensor-in tensor-out computation function  and some state, held in TensorFlow variables (the layer's weights).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each layer performs a specific mathematical operation and passes the processed data to the next layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Layers**: Building blocks of neural networks.\n",
    "- **Input Layer**: Receives input data.\n",
    "- **Hidden Layers**: Perform transformations on data.\n",
    "- **Output Layer**: Produces final predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Tensor in Keras?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **tensor** in Keras is a multi-dimensional array that is used to represent data. Tensors can have various shapes and data types, making them the basic building blocks of deep learning models. They are used to define inputs, outputs, weights, and activations within neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors are simmilar to numpay arrays, but can leverage parallel processing on GPUs through deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, making them highly efficient for large-scale computations in neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points:\n",
    "1. **Multi-Dimensional Array**: A tensor can be a scalar (0D), vector (1D), matrix (2D), or higher-dimensional array (3D, 4D, etc.).\n",
    "2. **Shape**: Defined by the number of dimensions and the size of each dimension. For example:\n",
    "   - `Scalar`: Shape `()`\n",
    "   - `Vector`: Shape `(3,)`\n",
    "   - `Matrix`: Shape `(3, 4)`\n",
    "   - `4D Tensor`: Shape `(batch_size, height, width, channels)`\n",
    "3. **Data Types**: Tensors can have different data types, such as `float32`, `int32`, etc.\n",
    "4. **Manipulation**: Tensors support various operations like addition, multiplication, reshaping, and slicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tensor Example in Keras:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a 2D tensor (Matrix)\n",
    "tensor_example = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])\n",

    "## 3. Defining a Simple Neural Network in Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to build a model in Keras depending on the complexity and structure of the neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Sequential Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Sequential** model is a linear stack of layers, where each layer has exactly one input and one output. It is used for simple feed-forward architectures without branching or skipping connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Simple Feed-Forward Network**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\n",
    "from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define a sequential model\n",
    "model = Sequential([\n",
    "    Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)),  # Input and Hidden Layer 1\n",
    "    Dense(16, activation='relu'),                            # Hidden Layer 2\n",
    "    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')                           # Output Layer\n",
    "])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Functional API\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Functional API** in Keras is more flexible than the Sequential model, allowing for complex architectures such as multi-input, multi-output models, or models with shared layers. Instead of stacking layers linearly, the Functional API enables defining models by connecting layers like a graph, which provides greater control over the network structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Define Input Layer**: Start by defining the input layer using `Input()`.\n",
    "- **Connect Layers**: Use layer instances (e.g., `Dense`) and connect them using function calls.\n",
    "- **Create the Model**: Pass the input and output layers to the `Model()` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from tensorflow.keras.models import Model\n",
    "from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the input layer\n",
    "inputs = Input(shape=(input_dim,))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the layers\n",
    "x1 = Dense(32, activation='relu')(inputs)   # Hidden Layer 1\n",
    "x2 = Dense(16, activation='relu')(x1)       # Hidden Layer 2\n",
    "outputs = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(x2) # Output Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create the model using the Functional API\n",
    "model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Model Subclassing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Subclassing** provides maximum flexibility and customization for building neural networks in Keras. It involves creating a custom class that inherits from the `tf.keras.Model` class and defining the network layers and their forward pass within the class. This approach is particularly useful when building complex models that require dynamic behavior or custom training loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Create a Custom Class**: Inherit from `tf.keras.Model` and define layers in the `__init__` method.\n",
    "- **Define the Forward Pass**: Implement the `call()` method, which specifies how the data flows through the layers.\n",

    "**Example:**\n",
